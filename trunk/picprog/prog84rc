# lp_cfg for BR870 and UniprogIV (ludpipo style programmer)
#
#The prog84 programmer requires the following bits to be named:
#  power --- set to 1 when the programmer wants the PIC's Vdd = +5v
#  mclr  --- set to 1 when the programmer wants the PIC's /MCLR = +13v
#  clock --- used to clock data into the PIC (connect to PIC pin 12)
#  data  --- used to write data (pin 13)
#  data_f -- sense return for data (pin 13)
#  clock_f - sense return for clock (pin 12)

#  rb6   --- synonym for "clock"
#  rb7   --- synonym for "data"
#  rb6_f --- synonym for "clock_f"
#  rb7_f --- synonym for "data_f"
